# Final-Project


Machine Learning:

Preprocessing data:

- Pandas Corr method will be used to determine the correlation of specific features to the outcome to usderstand if a particular feature is important enough to be fed into the odel.


Several supervised machine learning algorithms will be implemented to predict the movie ratings:
- RandomForestRegressor  
- DecisionTreesRegressor


For each algorithm, the following will be used to determine how well each model has performed and the best performing model will be used to make movie recommendations.
  
- Model's accuracy
- Model's Absolute errors
- Calculate mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
- Comparison of model's Y-tet values with Y_predictions
